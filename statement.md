Food Ordering Desktop Application (Tkinter-Based)


1. Problem Statement:

In many small cafés, canteens, and food outlets, ordering is still done manually, leading to delays, human errors, and inefficient order tracking. Customers do not always get a quick way to view the menu, add items, review their cart, and place an order digitally.

To solve this, a simple and user-friendly desktop-based Food Ordering System is required, where users can browse items, add them to a cart, view total pricing, and place orders smoothly.


2. Scope of the Project:

This project focuses on building a basic digital food ordering interface using Python's Tkinter GUI library.
The scope includes:

-Displaying a predefined menu with item names and prices.

-Allowing users to select items and add them to their cart.

-Showing cart contents with quantities and price calculations.

-Allowing users to place an order with confirmation.

-Providing a simple desktop GUI suitable for small food outlets, kiosks, or demo applications.

-The project is limited to in-memory operations (no database) and is designed for single-user usage.


3. Target Users:

Students looking to build simple ordering apps.

Small cafés and food stalls wanting a lightweight digital interface.

Beginners learning GUI development in Python.

Developers prototyping food-ordering logic without backend/database.
